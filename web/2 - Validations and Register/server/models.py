"""
SQLAlchemy uses the term "model" to refer to these classes and 
instances that interact with the database. In this module we then
define the SQLAlchemy models. 

But Pydantic also uses the term "model" to refer to something different,
the data validation, conversion, and documentation classes and instances.
